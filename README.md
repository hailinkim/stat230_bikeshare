# Bike Share Demand Prediction

# Introduction

- With rising gas prices and environmental concerns, bike share systems have become a popular alternative to automobiles for commuters.
- To keep up with the growing market, it is integral for bike share companies to collect data and be able to project their rental counts on any given day, as well as distinguish between registered users and casual, "one-time" users.
- We used data generated by Washington DC-based firm Capital Rideshare to see if we could predict rentals on a given day based on certain factors.
- **Research Question: What day-to-day factors can predict bike rental numbers on a given day, and do the factors change between casual and registered users?**

# Data

## There were 731 observations, each matching a day between 2011 and 2012 in the Capital Bike Share system, with weather and seasonal data from the Washington National weather station in DC, all taken from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

## Variables(used in final model)

### Categorical variables

1. **Season**: The season of the day.
2. **Holiday**: Whether the day is a holiday or not.
3. **Workingday**: Whether the day is a holiday/weekend or not.
4. **Weathersit**: The type of weather on the day in question.

### Numerical variables

1. **atemp**: The normalized feeling temperature of the day.
2. **hum**: The normalized humidity of the day.
3. **casual**: The number of casual bikesharers on that day.
4. **registered**: The number of registered bikesharers on that day.
5. **cnt**: The number of total bikesharers on that day.

Data takes normal form with response variable, count.

- Adjusted Temperature and Humidity found to be most relevant numerical variables
- WorkingDay, WeatherSit, and Season most relevant categorical variables
- Casual and Registered not included as predictors - will later be used to make separate models
