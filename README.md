# Bike Share Demand Prediction

# Introduction

- With rising gas prices and environmental concerns, bike share systems have become a popular alternative to automobiles for commuters.
- To keep up with the growing market, it is integral for bike share companies to collect data and be able to project their rental counts on any given day, as well as distinguish between registered users and casual, "one-time" users.
- We used data generated by Washington DC-based firm Capital Rideshare to see if we could predict rentals on a given day based on certain factors.
- **Research Question: What day-to-day factors can predict bike rental numbers on a given day, and do the factors change between casual and registered users?**
